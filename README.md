# FPS Boost Menu for FiveM

⚠ **Note**: Even though it may say "fork" somewhere, this is **not a fork** of any existing script. Initially, I planned to create a fork, but in the end, this script was built entirely from scratch by me.

## Overview
This script provides a simple **FPS Boost menu** for FiveM, allowing players to optimize their game performance dynamically. The menu offers different levels of optimization, from **Ultra Low to High FPS Boost**, and also includes an **Ultra Graphics** mode to restore high-quality settings.

## Features
✅ **Multiple FPS Boost Levels**: Choose from Ultra Low, Medium, and High optimizations.  
✅ **Ultra Graphics Mode**: Restore the best possible graphics settings.  
✅ **Reset Option**: Easily revert to default settings.  
✅ **Entity Optimization**: Removes unnecessary entities at a distance for better performance.  
✅ **Real-time Adjustments**: Applies optimizations dynamically while playing.  
✅ **Standalone & Lightweight**: Works independently with **ox_lib** as the only dependency.  
✅ **User-friendly Menu**: Uses **ox_lib** for an intuitive and clean UI.
